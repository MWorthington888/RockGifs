Rock Gif Program - Mike Worthington

This project is an exercise of two parts: 
    1) Creating buttons dynamically based on a user's input
    2) Accessing Giphy API through AJAX to search gifs based on the buttons created and populate them on our website

This exercise is our introduction to the construction of a queryURL with the API url, the search string and our API key.

We are also accessing an array to create buttons on the fly and pushing them to our page.
